# Jams

Jams is an order control system in a helmet company. The main objective is to manage the status of orders and help salesmen to create and visualize the status of their orders. On the other hand, it helps the accountants to manage the different payments that our clients does, because we have a lot of different ways to pay with banks and credit platforms.
